### Keeper of Reality

My friends Matthew and Olivia of the Seattle dreampop two piece Night Hikes just released their new album Keeper of Reality. I'd highly recommend giving the tracks Ethereal Shore and Heaven Only Knows a listen!

Here's a description of [Night Hikes](http://nighthikes.com/bio.html) from their official website:

> Night Hikes began in a garage on an autumn day in northern Indiana.
> Olivia Godby and Matthew Farrell met their first year at Notre Dame,
> only to discover a vivid musical connection as seniors. After
> spending 2016’s winter writing music, they went on to play a number
> of underground shows with local rap collective Trybe and to perform
> in South Bend’s festival Riverlights. Upon graduating, the duo moved
> to Southern California to begin work on their debut LP. Their music
> flickers on the cusp of the inner and outer worlds, navigating the
> tensions of wanting to be very much a spectator and a participant at
> the same time.

> The Blue Hour was self-recorded during summer in a 1950s era San
> Diego home. Inspired by a visit to Paris, the title evokes the magic
> of late dusk and a fascination with the transition of natural light
> throughout the day. New York City based artist and engineer Rusty
> Santos provided the mix, using leftover static and crunch to
> contribute a lo fi quality reminiscent of the band Broadcast. Beach
> House and Phantogram are also good references, as waves of distant
> guitars and dense vocals are anchored by a metallic synth bass and
> punching drums. Broken and abrupt by intent, The Blue Hour approaches
> clarity then recedes, preferring instead the spiritual haze of
> slipping into a lucid dream.
