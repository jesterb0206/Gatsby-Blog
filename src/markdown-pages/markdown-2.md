### Cola

Melancholic, atmospheric, pensive: those are few words that describe A Beacon School's 2019 release Cola. In anticipation of their upcoming album yoyo let's look back at one of the record's standout tracks, Cut Thru.

Lyrics:

<br>

Drawn in low light

Borne faint

Held

It starts to flood

In the same color

I know there're others

<br>
<br>

Old wind ever lifting

Taillights always swerving

Cracked but holding water

Blue and held together

<br>
<br>

I can hear you

<br>
<br>

’cause that's what you do

You cut thru

I can hear you

Yeah you cut thru

<br>
<br>

Take me to the fault line

Tell me we're fine

Nothing is breaking

It’s just rubbing and shaking

<br>
<br>

What's left to do?

You cut thru

I can hear you

I can hear you

I can hear you

I can hear you

<br>
<br>
